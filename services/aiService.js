Impressive background leading IT at ${profile.company}. Your experience across enterprise environments really stands out.

Most ${persona}s tell us legacy ITSM creates complexity rather than simplicity. At Atomicwork, our singular mission is delivering a service workforce, not just workflows.

Your technical leadership at ${profile.company} caught my attention. The challenge of scaling IT operations while maintaining service quality is significant.

Traditional ITSM tools force teams into rigid workflows. What if employees could get help through natural conversation, with Digital AI (multi-modal: voice, vision, chat) handling routing and resolution automatically?

That's what we've built - operating in the flow of work with full context understanding, not just another portal to visit.

Interested in a technical discussion about AI-native service architectures?

Best,

Your experience in ${profile.title} really resonates. Many IT leaders tell us they're tired of complex ticketing systems that add overhead instead of value.

We built Atomicwork specifically for this - one unified platform where AI handles the toiling work, letting your team focus on strategic initiatives instead of L1 tickets.

Built-in knowledge using your existing Okta/AD context eliminates traditional knowledge management overhead.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about operational efficiency?

Your background leading technology initiatives at ${profile.company} caught my attention. Balancing operational efficiency with service quality at enterprise scale requires the right approach.

Most platforms give you software where you do all the work. Atomicwork delivers a service workforce - focused on faster self-service first, not forcing everything to become a ticket.

Our clients typically see immediate improvements in both team productivity and employee satisfaction.

Could we schedule a brief call to discuss your service delivery strategy?

Traditional ITSM tools were built for Fortune 500 complexity management. Modern enterprises like yours need to move fast with lean teams.

Atomicwork delivers measurable results: 40% reduction in L1 tickets, improved SLA compliance, faster deployment than legacy alternatives.

What KPIs matter most for your IT operations, and how do you currently measure service delivery effectiveness?
